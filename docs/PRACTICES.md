# Practices

these are not only best practices, but a specification on the code style of the repo

* files and variables are named with underscores.
* always make sure standard functions are safe (beware of strcpy)!
* lines are indented 2 spaces each
* comments are given imperative by number of slashes (////// for title, //// for section, // for details)
